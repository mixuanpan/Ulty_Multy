	abstract = {Removing {EyeBlink} ({EB}) artifact is often an essential preprocessing step of {EEG}/{MEG} analysis. Subspace-based methods such as Independent Component Analysis ({ICA}) and Signal Source Projection ({SSP}) are well-known methods of {EB} artifact removal. However, these methods require preknowledge of the number of components ({NoC}) involved in the blinking segments which is unknown and estimated by visual inspection. Here, we provide a reliable and efficient method for estimating the {NoC} of {EB}. The method utilizes an {SVD} denoising approach denoted by Number of Source Eigenvalue Error ({NoSEE}). The proposed method performance is examined by synthetic {EEG}, and is validated by real {MEG} data. Root Mean Square Error ({RMSE}) is used to evaluate the performance while visual inspection on real {MEG} data is used to validate the algorithms results. In both cases, the proposed method provides optimum {NoC} in the sense of {MSE} minimization and consistency with the real data. The method provides more accurate results compared to manual methods. In addition, the low computational complexity of the algorithm results in much less processing time for this automatic {NoC} calculator compared to the trial and error procedure of the manual methods which enables the algorithm to be used in online {EEG} analysis.},

	abstract = {{sLORETA} is one of the well-established {EEG} source localization methods that is popular for its satisfactory estimation, simplicity, and fast computation. However, the method has a low-resolution and requires manual post-processing thresholding to provide a sparser solution with acceptable resolution in source detection. Here we propose a subspace based thresholding that results in a higher resolution brain imaging based on minimizing a desired least square source detection error. Simulation results show the proposed method, denoted by {HR}-{sLORETA}, provides stable and high resolution solution in terms of Percentage of Undetected Sources ({PUS}) and Spatial Dispersion ({SD}) compared to the existing manual thresholding approaches as well as Otsu thresholding approach. It is shown that {HR}-{sLORETA} outperforms Otsu, which is the only other available automatic thresholding method, in scenarios with three or more sources.},
